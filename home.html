        <h3>Congress has a wide range of powers enumerated by the United States Constitution. While key powers are explicitly given to Congress in Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution, it has obtained others through subsequent amendments and the "necessary and proper" clause which allows Congress to take actions that go beyond its explicitly enumerated powers in the interest of effectively performing its duties. Congressional powers can be divided into three categories: powers enumerated by Article 1 Section 8, powers enumerated elsewhere in the original text of the Constitution, and powers given to Congress in later years through the amendment process. I have listed many of these powers below in the interest of illuminating what Congress can and cannot do. </h3>
